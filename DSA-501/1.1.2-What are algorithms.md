#### What you'll learn

###### By the end of this lesson, you will be able to describe an algorithm.

#### Overview

###### Whether you are aware of it or not, you have been using algorithms your whole life. For example, in elementary school, you learned a series of steps for multiplying two numbers. You learned that if you follow those steps precisely, you will always get the correct result. That series of steps is an algorithm, and that's what you'll focus on in this lesson.

## Key Terms

Time complexity of an algorithm

The number of instructions (or steps) needed to execute the algorithm

Space complexity of an algorithm

The amount of memory used by the algorithm

The video below provides a brief introduction to algorithms. Start by watching the video, and then read through the rest of the lesson. This will give you a thorough understanding of this topic.

An algorithm is defined as a well-defined sequence of steps for solving a computational problem. Even though this definition is simple, it covers a few concepts that may be expanded.

Algorithm

A well-defined sequence of steps for solving a computational problem

First, break down the idea of a computational problem. A computational problem is a problem that a computer might be able to solve. For example, the problem of sorting a sequence of numbers in ascending order is a computational problem.

Problems must be well specified. That is, the statement of the problem must specify the inputs, outputs, and the relationship between the inputs and outputs. For example, the search problem may be defined as follows: given a sequence of n numbers and a number x as input, output the index of the first occurrence of the number x in the sequence. Output -1 if the number x isn't in the sequence.

There may be more than one way to solve that problem. An algorithm, then, is any sequence of steps that, if followed precisely, will solve the problem.

Next, note that the definition above specifies that the sequence of steps must be well defined. In other words, the steps must be unambiguous and complete. Here, unambiguous means that the instruction for a particular step can only mean one thing. And complete means that no steps are left out.

## The linear search algorithm

Here is an example of an algorithm that solves the search problem defined above.

`function linearSearch(sequence, x) {` `for (let i = 0; i < sequence.length; i++) {` `if (sequence[i] === x) {` `return i;` `}` `}` `return -1;`

`}`

This algorithm is complete and unambiguous. The statement let i=0 can only mean one thing: declare a variable named i and initialize it to the value 0. Similarly, each statement has a precise meaning.

You'll study this algorithm in more detail in a later lesson.

## A note on notation

In the study of algorithms, the programming language does not matter. An algorithm may be implemented in any programming language. What is relevant is what steps are needed to complete the task.

For this reason, you can write an algorithm using pseudocode. As you learned earlier in this program, pseudocode is a form of structured English used for describing algorithms. It resembles programming code but isn't concerned with details such as semicolons. The exact syntax of pseudocode is not important as long as it is unambiguous and clear.

The linear search algorithm above is written in JavaScript. In pseudocode, that algorithm may look like this:

`function linearSearch` `input: sequence - an unsorted array of numbers` `input: x - a number` `Initialize a variable i to 0` `Iterate while i is less than the length of sequence` `if the ith element of sequence is equal to x, then return i`

`if no element of sequence matches x, then return -1`

Alternatively, an algorithm may be depicted in a flow diagram, like this:

In this module, JavaScript will be used to specify the algorithms. This is because of the following reasons:

- You are already familiar with the syntax.
    
- Programming code is by definition unambiguous.
    
- Having the ability to directly run the code may help you to understand the algorithm.
    

## Properties of algorithms

The following video provides an introduction to the properties of algorithms.

Imagine that you are the judge at a baking contest. You would make your decisions by comparing the properties or characteristics of various cakes. For example, you would look at the fluffiness, aroma, moistness, taste, and appearance of each cake. It is by comparing these properties that you know which cake is the best.

Similarly, algorithm design and analysis involves a disciplined approach to studying the properties of algorithms. It is by comparing these properties that you can know which algorithm may be most suitable for use in a particular scenario.

The properties of an algorithm are as follows:

- Correctness: The output produced by the algorithm is correct for all valid input.
    
- Efficiency: The algorithm minimizes the use of the available computing resources.
    
- Determinism: The result of each step of the algorithm is determined only by the inputs and the results of the preceding steps.
    
- Finiteness: The algorithm must stop. It may take many steps, but eventually, it must terminate.
    
- Generality: The extent to which the algorithm applies to a set of inputs.
    

Proving that an algorithm is correct for all valid inputs requires some rigorous mathematics that is beyond the scope of this module. Rather, you will take a more informal approach to determining the correctness of an algorithm.

In this module, you are going to focus your attention on the efficiency of algorithms.

## Efficiency

Computing resources are limited. A good algorithm makes efficient use of these resources. Providing that an algorithm satisfies all the other properties, it is efficiency that differentiates various algorithms.

The resources that are most relevant are the memory of the computer and the CPU. An algorithm may be correct, but if it requires more RAM than is reasonably available, then it is useless. Similarly, if the algorithm requires more processing time than is available, it is useless.

The number of instructions (or steps) needed to execute an algorithm is called the time complexity of the algorithm. The amount of memory used by the algorithm is called the space complexity.

Algorithms are usually discussed in terms of their time and space complexity. Normally, the concern is with the time complexity rather than space complexity. This is because it is easier and cheaper to obtain space, and there are techniques for achieving space efficiency by spending more time.
