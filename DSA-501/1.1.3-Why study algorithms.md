###### Computers are getting faster every year, and memory is getting cheaper all the time. So is it still important to study algorithms? The answer is yes. In this lesson, you will examine some of the reasons why the study of algorithms is essential.

The video below provides a brief introduction to why algorithms are important. Start by watching the video, and then read through the rest of the lesson. This will give you a thorough understanding of this topic.

Algorithms are everywhere. They impact your life in meaningful ways, even if you do not directly use them yourself. Take a look at a few examples below.

[PageRank](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PageRank) is one of the algorithms that Google uses to order search results. If you have ever done a search on Google, you have used their PageRank algorithm. This algorithm attempts to measure the importance of a web page and its relevance to your search query.

The internet is made up of millions of nodes (computers and routers and other devices) that are all connected together in a vast array of connections. Moving data from one computer to another is an extremely complicated task. Yet, you do it every day with every web page that you visit, every email that you send, and every video call that you make.

To make this all work, there are a series of different routing algorithms that attempt to find the fastest route from your computer to any other computer that you are connected to on the internet.

The problem of [routing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Routing) is an area of active research. As internet access continues to grow cheaper, the number of nodes grows, and it becomes more and more critical to identify more efficient algorithms to enable routing.

The modern world would not be possible without encryption. Encryption is the process of obscuring a message so that third parties may not access the content of the message. Encryption is used to secure communication on the internet. If you have ever used online banking, done a credit card transaction, or even used an online email service like Gmail, then you have used an encryption algorithm.

The chances are good that you have used a ride-sharing service while hardly giving a thought to the technology behind such a service. The ride-sharing service wishes to optimize the use of its drivers and minimize idle time as well as wait times for its customers. Tracking numerous drivers on the move and numerous customers waiting for rides is a complex task that requires sophisticated algorithms.

Today, it is trivial to pinpoint your exact position on the surface of the planet with GPS. Your phone seems to know—with relative ease—that you visited your local Starbucks. But the technology behind this is far from trivial; it involves several complex systems all working together to find your position as you buy your coffee. [GPS](https://www.gps.gov/systems/gps/) works by synchronizing atomic clocks on a constellation of satellites orbiting the Earth with a ground-based control system and your phone. The algorithms involved are as complex as anything that humankind has ever created.

Just from the examples above, it should be clear that there are many useful algorithms already at work in the world today. But the story is far from complete. The hardware that makes up your computer implements many algorithms that enable the tasks that you do on your computer. The operating system is made up of a series of advanced algorithms for file management, CPU usage, networking, security, and a host of other services within the computer. Your browser uses many algorithms just to display a web page. And games that you play are possible because of sophisticated algorithms.

Generally, algorithms are a technology that has been used for commercial advantage and military benefit. For these reasons alone, the study of algorithms is a useful pursuit.

The video below provides an example to illustrate why algorithms are important.

Computers are fast and getting faster. Memory is cheap and getting cheaper. So why study algorithms at all? If you wanted to solve some problem at a faster rate, you could just wait a few years, and computers would solve the problem faster—right? Well, the story isn't quite that simple. Below, explore this through a concrete example.

Suppose that you had an array of 10 million elements, and you needed to sort those elements. There are two programmers, and they both say that they can write a program to sort those numbers for you. The first programmer, Bob, claims that he has a computer that can perform 10 billion instructions per second. The second programmer, Alice, says that she has a computer that can perform only 10 million instructions per second. So Bob's computer is 1,000 times faster than Alice's. It would seem that if you use Bob's computer, you will get your sorted array 1,000 times faster than using Alice's computer.

Intuitively, you may understand that as the size of the array increases, the length of time needed to sort the array also increases. So sorting 10 million elements will take longer than sorting 1 million elements. The question is, how much longer?

Bob's sorting algorithm uses n² instructions to sort n elements. For example, to sort 5 elements, Bob's algorithm will use 5², or 25 instructions (5²=5*5=25). And to sort 6 elements, it will use 6², or 36 instructions (6²=6*6=36). This is known as the running time of the algorithm. You will be taking a deep look at running time in the next few lessons.

On the other hand, Alice's sorting algorithm takes n log n (that is, n times log to base 2 of n) instructions to sort n elements. Don't worry if the math is starting to look complicated; it won't get any more complex than this. In this case, sorting 5 elements would take 12 instructions (5*log₂5=5*2.322=11.6), and sorting 6 elements would take 16 instructions (6*log₂6=6*2.585=15.51). (Note that the numbers are rounded for simplicity.)

How long would it take to sort 10 million elements using Bob's algorithm on Bob's computer? And how long would it take for Alice's computer using her algorithm?

Incredibly, Alice can sort 10 million elements in an array in just 24 seconds—while Bob would take almost 3 hours. That is more than 400 times as fast!

This gap grows significantly as the size of the array grows. You can use your calculator to see how long it takes to sort 20 million elements or 100 million elements. You will see that to sort 100 million elements, Alice's algorithm completes in 265 seconds, while Bob's algorithm completes in one million seconds—almost 12 days! That is almost 4,000 times as fast!

Of course, this is just a made-up example, but it serves to illustrate that a well-designed algorithm can produce benefits far beyond that of a faster computer.
