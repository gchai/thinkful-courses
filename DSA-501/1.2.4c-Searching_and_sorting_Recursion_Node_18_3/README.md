# Searching and sorting: Recursion drillsâ€”Fibonacci

In this challenge, you will solve a problem using recursion. The objective is to practice using recursion to think about and solve problems. You do not have to worry about the efficiency of your solutions.

## Fibonacci

Write a recursive function that prints the Fibonacci sequence of a given number. The Fibonacci sequence is a series of numbers in which each number is the sum of the 2 preceding numbers. The 0th Fibonacci number is defined as 0, and the 1st Fibonacci number is defined as 1. For example, the 7th Fibonacci number in a Fibonacci sequence is 13. The sequence looks as follows: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13... .
