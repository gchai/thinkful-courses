# Promises: Assessment

> _**Note:** If downloading the assessment files to your local machine, make sure you're running Node v18 before you run_ `npm install`.
> 
> 1. _Check which version you are running:_ `node -v`
> 2. _If needed, change the version to v18:_ `nvm use v18`
> 
> _For additional help, review the "Learn your tools: Visual Studio Code" lesson in the "Welcome" module._

## Instructions

To complete this assessment, you will need to build two functions, detailed below. Reach out for help if you need it!

_**Note:** This assessment requires you to write specific strings. Read the instructions carefully and make sure you include proper capitalization and punctuation. If you feel like you've got it right, but the tests aren't passing, ask for help!_

## Fortune-teller functions

You'll be using the following functions provided in the `./utils/fortune-teller.js` file. This library is just a way for you to practice working with promises. While you can see the source code in the file, you do not need to understand it fully or make any changes to it.

### `welcome()`

The `welcome()` function returns a promise that, when resolved, will return a short welcome string.

```
welcome().then((response) => {
  console.log(response);
  // "Provide me a question and I'll give you an answer..."
});
```

### `goodbye()`

The `goodbye()` function returns a promise that, when resolved, will return a short goodbye string.

```
goodbye().then((response) => {
  console.log(response);
  // "Best of luck in the future..."
});
```

### `tell()`

The `tell()` function takes a string and returns a promise that, when resolved, will return a random fortune.

```
tell("Will the weather be warm today?").then((response) => {
  console.log(response);
  // "Outlook good."
});
```

If no argument is provided, then the function will return a rejection that returns a short error message.

```
tell().catch((response) => {
  console.error(response);
  // "A question is required..."
});
```

## Functions to complete

Complete the following two functions to get the tests to pass.

### `getFortune()`

Write a function that takes a single argument, a question. Use the `tell()` function in the `getFortune()` function and then return both the question and the fortune with text before each.

```
getFortune("Will I ace my job interview?");
```

returns a promise that returns an array:

```
[
  "Your question was: Will I ace my job interview?",
  "Your fortune is: Outlook good.",
];
```

Make sure to include the phrases `Your question was:` and `Your fortune is:`.

If no question is provided, you should return an error message with the prefix `There was an error:`:

```
getFortune();
```

returns a promise that simply returns a string:

```
"There was an error: A question is required...";
```

### `fullSession()`

In this function, you will use the the `welcome()`, `tell()`, and `goodbye()` functions in that order. You will combine the responses from each. In the case of the `tell()` function, your output should look like the `getFortune()` function above. In fact, you are welcome to reuse parts of that function in this solution to avoid duplicate code.

```
fullSession("Will I complete my Promises Assignment?");
```

returns a promise that returns an array:

```
[
  "Provide me a question and I'll give you an answer...",
  "Your question was: Will I complete my Promises Assignment?",
  "Your fortune is: As I see it, yes.",
  "Best of luck in the future...",
];
```

If no question is provided, the `welcome()` response will be seen, then the error as before, then the`goodbye()` function, in that order.

```
fullSession();
```

returns a promise that returns the following array:

```
[
  "Provide me a question and I'll give you an answer...",
  "There was an error: A question is required...",
  "Best of luck in the future...",
];
```

## Tips

- The value returned by a `then()` is passed to the next `then()`.
- Use `push` to add one element to an array.
- Use [`concat`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/concat) to merge two arrays.
- You may complete this challenge on your own machine before uploading it to Qualified.
