# NoSQL databases: Assignment - Weather Tracker API

In this assignment, you are asked to complete the Mongoose model and controller functions for a Weather Tracker API.

> _**Note:** If downloading the assessment files to your local machine, make sure you're running Node v18 before you run_ `npm install`.
> 
> 1. _Check which version you are running:_ `node -v`
> 2. _If needed, change the version to v18:_ `nvm use v18`
> 
> _For additional help, review the "Learn your tools: Visual Studio Code" lesson in the "Welcome" module._

## Tasks

### 1. Create the Mongoose model for WeatherStatus (Independent)

In `weather.model.js`, complete the Mongoose model so that it include a date (Date), city (String), state(String), country (String), temperature (Number), and condition (String)

```
const schema = mongoose.Schema({
  // TODO: add date (Date), city (String), state(String), country (String), temperature (Number), and condition (String)


})
```

### 2. GET /weather - list all the weather documents (Independent)

In `weather.controller.js` complete the `list()` function so that it lists all the WeatherStatus documents in the database. For the tests to pass, make sure that `res.status` returns a `200`. `res.body` should look something like this:

```
[
  {
    _id: '6310cd192459c24367f150fc',
    date: '2022-08-09T00:00:00.000Z',
    city: 'San Antonio',
    state: 'Texas',
    country: 'United States of America',
    temperature: 90,
    condition: 'Sunny',
    __v: 0
  }
]
```

### 3. POST /weather - add a new weather status (AI-Assisted)

In `weather.controller.js` complete the `create()` function so that it creates a new document with the information that was sent from the POST request. `res.status` should returns a `201` and res.body should return the document that was added like this:

```
{
  data: {
    date: '2022-08-10T00:00:00.000Z',
    city: 'San Antonio',
    state: 'Texas',
    country: 'United States of America',
    temperature: 90,
    condition: 'Sunny',
    _id: '6310cd192459c24367f150ff',
    __v: 0
  }
}
```

**Note:** you can use the following format to add the date: `"2022-08-09"`. Mongoose automatically converts it to the Date format that you see in the JSON file (`date: '2022-08-10T00:00:00.000Z'`).

**Hint:** Use `res.status(201).json({ data: newWeatherStatus });` to return the status and the new weather status.

### 4. GET /weather/:weatherStatusId - get the weather status with a specific id (Independent)

In `weather.controller.js` complete the `read()` function so that it returns the weather status with the `:weatherStatusId`. The response should look something like this

```
{
  data: {
    _id: '6310d3a86a720e0c4bf3e8d0',
    date: '2022-08-09T00:00:00.000Z',
    city: 'San Antonio',
    state: 'Texas',
    country: 'United States of America',
    temperature: 90,
    condition: 'Sunny',
    __v: 0
  }
}
```

**Hint:** After implementing the `read()` function, don't forget to add the controller (`.get(controller.read)`) to the router in `weather.router.js`

### 5. PUT /weather/:weatherStatusId - update the weather status with a specific id (Independent)

In `weather.controller.js` complete the `update()` function so that it updates a weather status. The response should return the updated weather status.

```
{
  data: {
    _id: '6310d3a86a720e0c4bf3e8d5',
    date: '2022-08-10T00:00:00.000Z',
    city: 'San Diego',
    state: 'California',
    country: 'United States of America',
    temperature: 80,
    condition: 'Sunny',
    __v: 0
  }
}
```

### 6. DELETE /weather/:weatherStatusId - delete the weather status with a specific id (AI-Assisted)

In `weather.controller.js` complete the `read()` function so that it returns the weather status with the `:weatherStatusId`. Only return a `204` status code after the document was deleted.

## Tips

- Review the code in the lesson. The methods that you are asked to implement should be very similar.
- If you are working on the web IDE you only need to make changes on the `weather.model.js` and `weather.controller.js` files.
- If you are working on this assignment from your local machine, follow the instructions below to get the code running. Make sure to only drag the `weather.controller.js` and `weather.model.js` to Qualified when submitting.

## Working on your local machine

Some extra steps are necessary if you are working on this project from your machine.

1. Download the code and unzip it into your working folder.
2. Set your MongoDB connection string in `DATABASE_URL` in your `.env` file.
3. Uncomment the `mongoose.connect` code in `app.js`.
4. Type `npm install` and then `npm start` to start the server. To run the tests type `npm test`.
5. When you are done passing the tests and want to submit to Qualified, only drag the `weather.controller.js` and `weather.model.js` files into Qualified. Do not drag-and-drop `app.js` or the `.env` file (submitting your .env file will make your connection string visible to others and may cause issues with the tests).
