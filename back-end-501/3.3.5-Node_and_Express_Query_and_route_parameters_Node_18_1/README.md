## Instructions (Independent)

You should work on this assessment independently, without the use of AI tools.

Your goal for this assessment is to get the tests to pass. To do so, you will need to fix the code that already exists inside of the `app.js` file. Carefully look over the order of the routes and how the different route and query parameters are being used to solve this challenge.
