## Instructions (Independent)

You should work on this lesson independently, without the use of AI assistance.

Your goal for this lesson is to get the tests to pass. To do so, you will need to create two routes. Both are very similar, but pay close attention to the output of each.

### Routes

#### `/ping`

This route should respond with the following text:

```
pong!
```

#### `/welcome`

The route would respond with the following text:

```
Welcome to my server.
```
